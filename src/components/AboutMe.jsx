            development since 2021 and graduated as <span>Frontend Developer</span> from the
            Argentina Programa 4.0 Front End Development course in 2023. Since
            then, I've been continuously expanding my knowledge by taking
            various online courses and building personal projects to sharpen my
            skills and explore new technologies.
